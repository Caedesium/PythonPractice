# PythonPractice
#
Starting a repo for Python practice, don't expect me to write any code that changes the world here.
Most of the practice was done in Replit, which I'll be using to start before uploading. 
I'll also eventually transition to an acutal IDE.
As a sidenote, Notepad++ is amazing!
Time to get coding!
